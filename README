The program implements a routing functionality based on routing tables and ARP, managing IPv4 packets.

The main components are:
- `rtable`: the routing table, which contains the necessary entries for packet forwarding.
- `arp_table`: the ARP table, which maintains a mapping between IP addresses and MAC addresses, used to determine the MAC address of the next hop.

### Main Functionalities

- **Sorting the routing table**: The table is sorted to optimize the search (using `qsort`) for the best route. Sorting is done based on the network mask, and in the case of equal masks, the prefixes are compared.
  
- **Determining the best route**: It searches the sorted routing table for the best route for a destination IP address using binary search. It returns the corresponding entry from the table or `NULL` if no suitable route is found.

- **Searching the ARP table**: It searches the ARP table to find the MAC address associated with an IP address. It returns the corresponding entry or `NULL` if none exists.

- **Packet processing**:
  The program receives packets, extracts the Ethernet and IP headers, and processes each packet as follows:
  - Verifies that the packet type is IPv4.
  - Checks the validity of the checksum.
  - Determines the best route and checks the TTL.
  - Decrements the TTL and recalculates the checksum.
  - Looks up the MAC address for the next hop.
  - Updates the destination MAC address and sends the packet.
